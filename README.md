# Hospital Patient Management System (DSA-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hospital Patient Management System** is a console-based application designed using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. The system helps manage patient records, doctor information, appointments, and billing efficiently without using databases. All operations are performed using in-memory data structures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Manage patient records efficiently
* Apply core **DSA concepts** in a real-world problem
* Perform fast searching, insertion, deletion, and sorting
* Understand time and space complexity in practical use cases

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:**  C++ (DSA-based)
* **Concepts:**

  * Data Structures
  * Algorithm

## 🧩 Data Structures Used

| Feature            | Data Structure Used     | Purpose                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Patient Records    | Linked List             | Dynamic storage of patient data |
| Doctor Records     | Array / Vector          | Store fixed doctor details      |
| Appointments       | Queue                   | FIFO appointment scheduling     |
| Emergency Patients | Priority Queue          | Handle critical patients first  |
| Patient Search     | Binary Search           | Fast record retrieval           |
| Sorting Records    | Merge Sort / Quick Sort | Sort by age, ID, or priority    |
| Billing            | Stack                   | Maintain transaction history    |
